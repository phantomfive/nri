|APP DESCRIPTION |
+----------------+

This will choose a selection of questions from a list.

+-----------------+
| RUNNING THE APP |
+-----------------+
If you have java installed on your system, then you should be able to run:

$ my_great_app 5

The parameter represents the number of questions to select. If a number is
not specified, the app will default to 1.

| SOURCE CODE |
+-------------+
The code is Java. I used Eclipse to edit it, but it should work fine with
IntelliJ or whatever editor you use. Tests are available, as well.
